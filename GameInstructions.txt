- Fill in a KENO play slip with the number of spots (numbers) you want to play per game.  Choose from 1 to 10 spots.

- Select how many games in a row you want to play:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 20.

- Mark your numbers from 1 to 80.  Or, mark "Quick Pick" and let the computer randomly pick your numbers for you.
  The number of numbers you pick must equal the number of spots you selected to play.
  (Example:  If you select "4 spots" in section 1 of the play slip, select 4 numbers in section 4.)

- Remember:  If you chose Quick Pick, you must tell the application how many numbers you want for each game
  and how many games you want to play.

- A win occurs when some or all of your numbers (spots) are matched by the computer.  It is even possible to win a
  cash prize if none of your numbers are drawn (see 10-spot and 9-spot games).
